# PHP_Login_system
I have created user registration in PHP with the login script.  On the landing page, it shows a login form with a signup link. The registered user can enter their login details with the login form. Once done, he can get into the dashboard after successful authentication.  If the user does not have an account, then he can click the signup option to create a new account.  The user registration form requests username, email, password from the user. On submission, PHP code allows registration if the email does not already exist.  This example code has client-side validation for validating the entered user details. And also, it includes contains the server-side uniqueness test. The user email is the base to check uniqueness before adding the users to the MySQL database.
